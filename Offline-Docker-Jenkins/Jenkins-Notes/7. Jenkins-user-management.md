							✅ User Management in Jenkins 



*User Management in Jenkins refers to the process of creating, assigning roles, and controlling access permissions for different users within Jenkins*.
--It ensures the right people have the right access to perform their tasks securely, whether they are administrators, developers, or testers.

✅ Purpose of User Management

🔒 Security ➜ Protect Jenkins by restricting admin access.
📋 Accountability ➜ Track who triggered builds, made changes, etc.


✅ Example
User		Role		Permissions
admin		Admin		Full control over Jenkins
cair		Developer	Can build jobs, view logs, but no admin tasks
tester		Tester		Can trigger builds, read results


🎯 Goal of User Management in Jenkins---(✅ Admin can see everything in Jenkins)

User Management in Jenkins is about controlling who can log in and what they are allowed to do inside Jenkins.

Create users.
Define roles with specific permissions.
Assign users to these roles.
✅ This controls:

Who can view, build, configure, or administer Jenkins.

Control who can:

✅ Login
✅ See jobs
✅ Run jobs
✅ Change configurations
✅ Administer Jenkins
👉 This is done by creating users and assigning roles with specific permissions.



✅ Step 1: Jenkins User Accounts (How to Create Users)
🔧 Create a User in Jenkins:
Login as Admin (you need admin access to create users).
Go to Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage Users.
Click on Create User.

Field			Example
Username		dev_user
Password		password123
Full name		Developer User
Email			dev@example.com

Click ➜ Create User.
✅ Now, the cair user can log in to Jenkins.




✅ Step 2: How Jenkins Controls Access (Security Setup)
After making users, Jenkins needs to know: 👉 "What can this user do?"
#note
By default, Jenkins doesn’t give you fine-grained control.
You’ll need to install a plugin to manage Roles and Permissions.



✅ Step 3: Install "Role-Based Strategy" Plugin (For Permissions/Roles)

This plugin allows you to create roles and assign specific permissions to users.

🔧 How to Install:
Go to ➜ Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage Plugins ➜ Available tab.
Search for ➜ Role-Based Authorization Strategy.
Click ➜ Install without restart.
After installing ➜ Go to ➜ Manage Jenkins ➜ Configure Global Security.
Under Authorization, select ➜ Role-Based Strategy.
Click ➜ Save.

✅ Now, Jenkins lets you create Roles and assign them to users.





✅ Step 4: Create Roles (Define Permissions for Users)
🎯 Example: You want 3 types of users

Role		What they can do
Admin		Do everything (create jobs, manage users, install plugins).
Developer	Build jobs, read logs, configure jobs (but NOT administer Jenkins).
Tester		Only trigger jobs and read job status. No editing allowed.


🔧 How to Create These Roles:
Go to ➜ Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage and Assign Roles ➜ Manage Roles.
You’ll see a Roles Table:
In the Role Name field ➜ Type:
1.admin
2.developer
3.tester
Click ➜ Add (this creates the roles).


✅ Example Permissions to Set for Each Role:
1. ➡️ Admin Role
✅ Overall ➜ Admin (full permissions)
✅ Job ➜ Read, Build, Configure, Delete
✅ View ➜ Read
✅ Credentials ➜ Create, Update, Delete
➡️ This role can do everything in Jenkins.


2. ➡️ Developer Role
✅ Overall ➜ Read
✅ Job ➜ Read, Build, Configure
✅ View ➜ Read
➡️ This role can create and configure jobs, but not manage Jenkins itself.


3. ➡️ Tester Role
✅ Overall ➜ Read
✅ Job ➜ Read, Build
✅ View ➜ Read
➡️ This role can trigger builds and view job results, but can’t edit or delete jobs.


##note:- Once permissions are set ➜ Click ➜ Save.







✅ Step 5: Assign Users to Roles
Now that roles exist, you need to assign users to them.

🔧 How to Assign:

1.Go to ➜ Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage and Assign Roles ➜ Assign Roles.

2.Under the Global Roles section:
In the User/group to add box ➜ Type your Jenkins username (e.g. cair).
Click ➜ Add.

3.Assign cair to one of the roles by ticking the checkbox:

✅ Tester (for read and build access)
✅ Developer (for more access)
✅ Admin (for full access)


Example Table:
User		admin		developer	tester
cair				  		  ✅

Click ➜ Save.
✅ Now cair has the Tester role and can trigger jobs, read statuses, but cannot modify Jenkins configurations.





##note
Global Roles ➜ Controls overall access to Jenkins system-wide
Item Roles ➜ Controls access to jobs/pipelines/projects.
Agent Roles ➜ Controls access to Jenkins agents/nodes.


#Example of above three roles

✅ 1️⃣ Global Roles (For General Access)
"Global Roles" at the top, click ➜ Manage Jenkins ➜ Configure Global Security, and make sure Role-Based Strategy is selected.
In Global Roles, you define:

Role Name		What It Controls
admin			Full Jenkins control
developer		Build and configure jobs, no admin
tester			View and trigger builds, no changes

✅ Steps to create:

In the "Role to add" box ➜ Type: tester
Click ➜ Add
Now you see a row for tester.
Tick permissions like:
Overall → Read ✅
Job → Read ✅
Job → Build ✅
(You can also grant "Job/Discover" if you want them to list jobs.)
➤ After creating Global Roles, assign them later in Assign Roles.




✅ 2️⃣ Item Roles (For Specific Jobs/Pipelines Access)--optional

🎯 When to use Item Roles?
If you want different permissions per project/job.
Example:
Developer A ➜ Access project-1 only
Developer B ➜ Access project-2 only

✅ How to Create an Item Role

1.In Item Roles, go to ➜ Role to add ➜ Type:
Example ➜ project-tester
2.In the Pattern field ➜ Enter the job/project name pattern.
Example ➜ .* (matches all jobs)
Example ➜ project-1.* (only jobs starting with project-1)
3.Click ➜ Add
Now you'll see a row for project-tester.
✅ Set permissions like:

Job → Read ✅
Job → Build ✅
Job → Discover ✅
➡️ These allow users to see and trigger builds on specific jobs.





✅ 3️⃣ Agent Roles (For Specific Nodes/Agents Access)------optional
You only need Agent Roles if:

You have multiple Jenkins nodes (agents).
You want to control who can use them.
✅ How to Create an Agent Role

1.In Agent Roles, type the Role to add ➜ Example ➜ agent-user.
2.Enter Pattern ➜ Example ➜ .* (matches all agents).
3.Click ➜ Add

✅ Set permissions like:

Agent → Connect ✅
Agent → Build ✅
➡️ Controls who can run builds on nodes.







✅ Global Roles
Definition:

Controls system-wide access to Jenkins (login, manage users, security, plugins).
When to Use:

When you need to give someone admin permissions or basic access to Jenkins as a whole.


✅ Item Roles
Definition:

Controls access to jobs/pipelines/projects (who can view, build, configure, or delete them).
When to Use:

When you need to limit access to specific jobs/pipelines for different users or teams.



✅ Agent Roles
Definition:

Controls access to Jenkins agents/nodes (the machines that run your builds).
When to Use:

When you need to decide who can manage or use Jenkins build nodes, especially in large setups with many agents.





✅ Step 6: Generate API Token (Optional - For Tools like Tuleap)

You generate them inside Jenkins, under your user profile, not in the security section (Manage Jenkins).

🔧 How to Create an API Token for cair:

Log in to Jenkins as ➜ cair.
On the top-right ➜ Click your username ➜ Click ➜ Configure.
Scroll to ➜ API Token.
Click ➜ Generate New Token ➜ Give it a name ➜ Click ➜ Generate.
Copy the token ➜ Paste it into Tuleap's Jenkins CI configuration.

✅ Tuleap will now connect to Jenkins using the cair user and its token.


✅ Step 7: Verify and Test User Permissions
Login as ➜ cair (or test Tuleap CI connection).

Verify that cair can:
See jobs ✅
Trigger builds ✅
But cannot do anything else (like configure Jenkins or delete jobs ❌).



✅ Step 8: Security Best Practices

🔐 Tip							✅ Why?
Disable "Anyone can do anything"			Ensures Jenkins is secured.
Use Role-Based Authorization				Controls who can do what.
Disable anonymous access (optional)			Stops public viewing of Jenkins.
Use API tokens for external tools			More secure than using passwords.


✅ Example Use Case with Tuleap + Jenkins
cair user ➜ Assigned the Tester role in Jenkins.
Tuleap ➜ Connected to Jenkins using cair's API Token.
Tuleap ➜ Triggers Jenkins jobs ✅
Jenkins only shows Tuleap what cair is allowed to see (e.g., job build status, trigger builds).





########################################## simple end-to-end job example ########################################################

🎯 Goal:
👉 Create a user (cair) in Jenkins and assign limited permissions.
👉 Create a user (mahesh) in Tuleap.
👉 Connect Tuleap to Jenkins using the cair user to trigger jobs.

## Whenever you push code to Tuleap, it will trigger the Jenkins job using the cair user. The cair user has limited permissions, ensuring security while allowing job execution


✅ Step 1: Create a Jenkins User (cair)

🔧 How to create a user in Jenkins:
Login to Jenkins as admin.
Go to ➜ Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage Users.
Click ➜ Create User.

Username: cair
Password: ****** (any password)
Full name: cair user
Email: cair@example.com

Click ➜ Create User.

✅ Now you have a Jenkins user ➜ cair.

#note ✅ You must do these actions as the admin user in Jenkins



✅ Step 2: Create Roles and Permissions in Jenkins(admin)

🔧 Install Role-Based Authorization Strategy Plugin

Go to Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage Plugins.
Search for Role-Based Authorization Strategy.
Install the plugin (if not already installed).

🔧 Set Role-Based Security

Go to Manage Jenkins ➜ Configure Global Security.
Under Authorization, select Role-Based Strategy.
Click Save

🔧 Create a Role (e.g., tester)

Go to Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage and Assign Roles ➜ Manage Roles.
Under Global Roles, type tester and click Add.
Assign the following permissions to the tester role:
Overall: Read
Job: Read + Build
View: Read
Click Save.


🔧 Assign cair to the tester Role

Go to Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage and Assign Roles ➜ Assign Roles.
Under Global Roles, type cair and click Add.
Assign the tester role to cair by checking the box under tester.
Click Save.

✅ Now cair can see and trigger jobs but cannot change Jenkins settings.



✅ Step 3: Generate API Token in Jenkins (for Admin)

Goal:
Generate an API token for the admin user in Jenkins.

Use this token in Tuleap to authenticate and trigger Jenkins jobs.

Step-by-Step Process
1.Login to Jenkins as Admin:
Open your Jenkins instance (e.g., https://jenkins.isrd.cair.drdo:8443).
Log in using the admin credentials.

2.Navigate to User Configuration:
On the top-right corner of the Jenkins dashboard, click on the admin username.
From the dropdown menu, select Configure.

3.Scroll to the API Token Section:
On the configuration page, scroll down to the API Token section.

4.Generate a New Token:
In the API Token section, click on the Generate New Token button.
A dialog box will appear asking for a Token Name.
Enter a name for the token, e.g., tuleap-admin-token.
Click Generate.

5.Copy the Token:
Once the token is generated, it will be displayed on the screen.
Copy the token and save it securely (e.g., in a password manager or a secure file).
Note: You won’t be able to see this token again after you close the dialog, so make sure to copy it immediately.

✅ This token will be used in Tuleap to authenticate as the admin user and trigger Jenkins jobs.




✅ Step 4: Configure Jenkins Integration in Tuleap
🎯 Goal
Use the Jenkins URL and API token in Tuleap to connect and trigger jobs automatically or manually (e.g., after a Git push).

Go to Tuleap Jenkins Integration Settings
git--jenkins
✅ Example:
Jenkins URL ➜ https://jenkins.isrd.cair.drdo:8443/
Token ➜ XXXXXXXXXXXXX (paste the token)

##Test Connection
Tuleap may have a Test Connection button.
Click it to verify the connection works.
If successful ➜ You’re now linked!





####################################################### Basic questions ####################################################

✅ 1️⃣ Why Are Jobs Visible to Both Admin and cair Users?
Jobs are visible on both sides because:

Both users have permissions to see them.
If cair has Job ➜ Read permission, they can view the job.
Admin always has full access by default (can see/manage all jobs).


✅ Real-Time Jenkins User Management Explained

✅ 2️⃣ Who Manages Jenkins?
admin user ➜ Manages everything
➤ Creates/Deletes users
➤ Manages Roles & Permissions
➤ Installs plugins, configures security, sets up nodes
➤ Assigns users to roles
➤ Handles system administration tasks (backup, updates, etc.)



✅ 3️⃣ What Can the cair User Do in Jenkins?

Depends on role assignment. Example:

➤ If Tester ➜ Trigger jobs, read logs, view job status
➤ If Developer ➜ Build jobs, configure jobs, read logs
➤ If Admin ➜ Full control (if you assign this role)

cair cannot (unless explicitly allowed):
✖️ Manage Users
✖️ Install Plugins
✖️ Configure Security
✖️ Delete Jenkins Jobs (if no permission)


✅ 4️⃣ How Do You Control Who Sees or Does What in Jenkins?

By using the Role-Based Authorization Strategy Plugin:
➤ Create Roles (Admin, Developer, Tester)
➤ Assign specific permissions to those roles
➤ Assign users (like cair) to the roles


✅ 5️⃣ How Does Tuleap Trigger Jenkins Jobs?

➤ Tuleap uses API token (usually from cair user)
➤ The token grants Tuleap the same permissions as cair
➤ Tuleap can trigger builds, view statuses, but cannot modify Jenkins (unless cair has those permissions)


✅ 6️⃣ Why Can’t cair See Certain Jobs or Nodes?

Possible reasons:
✖️ cair’s role doesn’t have Item Role permission for that job
✖️ cair’s role doesn’t have Agent Role permission for nodes
✖️ Role-Based Strategy isn’t configured properly


✅ 7️⃣ How Do You Create a New User in Jenkins?

Login as Admin
Go to ➜ Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage Users
Click ➜ Create User
Fill in:
➤ Username ➜ cair
➤ Password ➜ ******
➤ Full Name ➜ cair user
➤ Email ➜ cair@example.com


✅ 8️⃣ How Do You Assign a Role to cair?

Login as Admin
Go to ➜ Manage Jenkins ➜ Manage and Assign Roles ➜ Assign Roles
Under Global Roles, add user cair
Tick role ➜ Tester / Developer / Admin
Click ➜ Save

✅ Now cair has access based on their role.


✅ 9️⃣ What Are Global, Item, and Agent Roles?

Role Type		What It Controls				Example Usage
Global			Jenkins-wide permissions			Admin, Developer, Tester roles
Item			Specific job/project access			Project-specific testers/developers
Agent			Access to Jenkins nodes/agents			Control which nodes a user can build on


✅ 1️⃣0️⃣ Why Use cair Instead of Admin for Tuleap Integration?

➤ Security Best Practice:

cair has limited permissions (Principle of Least Privilege).
Even if Tuleap is compromised, Jenkins Admin is still secure.
➤ API tokens are safer with restricted roles.


✅ 1️⃣1️⃣ How to Verify cair’s Permissions?

➤ Login as cair
➤ Try to:
✅ View jobs
✅ Trigger builds
✅ Read logs
❌ Create jobs (if not allowed)
❌ Manage Jenkins settings (unless admin)
➤ This ensures cair has appropriate access.


✅ 1️⃣2️⃣ What Happens If cair Has No Roles Assigned?

➤ cair can’t:
✖️ Login (if Role-Based Strategy blocks it)
✖️ See jobs
✖️ Trigger builds
✖️ Do anything meaningful
✅ You must assign at least read permissions!


✅ 1️⃣3️⃣ Tuleap Jenkins Integration Not Working with cair Token—Why?

Possible reasons:
✖️ cair doesn’t have Job ➜ Build permission
✖️ API Token expired or invalid
✖️ Tuleap Jenkins URL or credentials misconfigured
✅ Solution ➜ Assign correct roles + regenerate API token


✅ 1️⃣4️⃣ Why Is Admin Token Working but cair’s Isn’t?

➤ Admin has full permissions by default
➤ cair’s role may not have access to:

Specific jobs
Nodes
Trigger builds
➤ Verify cair’s Role-Based Strategy settings




###################################  Security Best Practices for Jenkins User Management #############################

✅ Practice					✅ Why
Disable “Anyone can do anything”		Prevent anonymous/uncontrolled access
Use Role-Based Authorization			Fine-grain control over user access
Use API Tokens, not passwords			Safer for integrations (Tuleap, Git)
Assign Least Privilege				Reduce risk in case of compromise
Regularly Review User Roles			Ensure access is still appropriate








✅ Simple Diagram (User Management in Jenkins):

[ Admin User ]
     |
     |-- Manages Users & Roles
     |-- Configures Jenkins (Security, Plugins, Nodes)
     |
[ cair User ]
     |
     |-- Assigned Role (Tester/Developer)
     |-- Runs Jobs, Triggers Builds (based on role)
     |
[ Tuleap ]
     |
     |-- Connects using cair's API token
     |-- Triggers Jenkins Pipelines (limited to cair's access)
